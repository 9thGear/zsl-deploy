# Minimal Node Setup

This is a template directory for setting up a Quorum ZSL node using the RAFT consensus mechanism

There are still a few requirements needed in order to boot a node using this template, such as:

- Updating `genesis.json`
- Generating keys
- Updating `passwords.txt`
- Updating `static-nodes.json`
- Updating `tm.conf`
